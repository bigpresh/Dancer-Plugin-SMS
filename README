NAME
    Dancer::Plugin::SMS - Easy SMS sending from Dancer apps

SYNOPSIS
    In your Dancer app:

        # Positional params ($to, $message)
        sms '+44788....', 'Hello there!';

        # Or named params
        sms to => '+44...', text => 'Hello!';

    In your Dancer `config.yml', provide the SMS::Send::* driver name, and
    whatever params are appropriate for that driver (see the driver
    documentation for details) - example configuration for using
    SMS::Send::AQL:

        plugins:
            SMS:
                driver: 'AQL'
                _login: 'youraqlusername'
                _password: 'youraqlpassword'
                _sender: '+4478....'

DESCRIPTION
    Provides a quick and easy way to send SMS messages using SMS::Send
    drivers (of which there are many, so chances are the service you want to
    use is already supported; if not, they're easy to write, and if you want
    to change providers later, you can simply update a few lines in your
    config file, and you're done.

Keywords
  sms
    Send an SMS message. You can pass the destination and message as
    positional params:

        sms $to, $message;

    Or, you can use named params:

        sms to => $to, text => $message;

    The latter form may be clearer, and would allow any additional
    driver-specific parameters to be passed too, but the former is terser.
    The choice is yours.

  sms_driver
    Returns the SMS::Send driver object, in case you need to do things with
    it directly.
